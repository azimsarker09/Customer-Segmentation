# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how unsupervised machine learning techniques, particularly K-Means clustering, can be used to segment customers based on their behavior and demographic information.

## 📊 Overview

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, personalize offers, and improve customer satisfaction.

This project utilizes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (including date parsing and encoding)
- Dimensionality reduction using **PCA** and **t-SNE**
- Clustering using **K-Means**
- Visualization and interpretation of segments
